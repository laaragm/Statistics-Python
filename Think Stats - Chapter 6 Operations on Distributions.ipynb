    "Skewness is a statistic that measures the asymmetry of a distribution. Negative skewness indicates that a distribution extends farther to the left than the right. Positive skewness indicates the opposite. Since it's sensitive to outliers, it's usually not a good idea to compute skewness. Besides, there are another ways to evaluate the asymmetry of a distribution such as by looking at the relationship between the mean and the median. Pearson's median skewness coefficient is an alternative way to compute the skewness."
